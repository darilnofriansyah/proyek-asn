    "description1_about":"Critical Occupational Variety or Critical Occupation List is a living database that summarizes the results of the identification of a number of critical skills and job positions required by an organization in responding to the needs of the times. The Critical Occupational Variety is designed to help relevant officials ensure the alignment of human resource development policies within an organization with the actual needs that are urgently needed by superiors or employers in meeting organizational goals (World Bank Group, 2019). For the government, the Critical Occupational Variety provides an actual picture of the map of ASN human resource needs to reduce the skills gap needed to meet national targets.",

This approach builds a direct evidence base from stakeholders and builds contextual knowledge of the employment sector so that compilers can better interpret indicators, communicate decisions and monitor TPF. This approach is carried out in two ways: first, a Call for Evidence (CfE) survey which is conducted to collect information through surveys to relevant stakeholders both at the central and regional levels. Second, stakeholder consultation, which is a more in-depth consultation with stakeholders through Focus Group Discussions (FGD).",

Jobs that fall into the 'deficiency' and 'strategic' categories are identified through several complementary steps. Then, after integrating the evidence from the top down and bottom up approaches, a validation process was carried out by conducting discussions with stakeholders in order to provide input on the proposed list of deficiencies to ensure that the work included those of strategic importance."
